⚔️ WHAT IS HASHIRA TRAINING ??:

I recently built a unique task management app inspired by Demon Slayer, combining productivity with anime-style motivation! 🌟

🔑 Key Highlights:

🎨 Anime-Inspired Design:
Dark theme with a black background, primary red, and secondary green colors to capture that Demon Slayer vibe.

✅ Task Management:
Users can add, delete, and manage tasks — themed as “Defeat Your Inner Demons”. Completing tasks increases your Demon Slain points.

🔥 Streak & Rank System:
Daily task completion builds a streak. Your rank grows with consistency — reach Hashira Rank after maintaining a 180-day streak!

🗂️ Default Tasks & Profiles:
First-time users get 5 default empty task cards. Profiles come with preset avatars (Hashiras, Tanjiro, Nezuko) — or you can choose your own from the gallery.

🏅 Gamification:
For every task completed, users earn Demon Slain points. Completed tasks are locked for the day, boosting daily discipline.

🔒 Firebase Authentication:
Secure user login with email/password using Firebase Auth.

📲 Local Storage:
Streaks, points, and custom avatars are saved locally using Shared Preferences.

🖼️ Custom Avatar Selection:
Integrated Image Picker for personalized profile pictures.

🎬 Smooth Intro Animation:
Simple 2-second splash animation on launch to make the experience engaging.

ℹ️ About Section:
A dedicated section to share the idea behind the app and instructions for new users.
